<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>In this tutorial, we demonstrate how to work with basics of growth modeling. We describe the data, run some individual level models, and work through no-growth and linear growth modeling examples. We then expand on that model in two ways. We add a predictor - to get the conditional growth model; and we change the time-metric - to illustrate how alternative time metrics facilitate different interpretations.</p>
